## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1–2 white onions, sliced or diced
- 1–2 red bell peppers, chopped
- 1 pack vegan chicken (e.g. Gardein, Daring, or Soy-Free Sub)
- Vegan nacho cheese (e.g. Violife, Follow Your Heart, or homemade)
- Sub rolls or hoagie rolls
- Vegan mayo
- Vegan butter for toasting buns/rolls
- 1–2 tbsp olive oil

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

2. Heat a skillet with olive oil. Once warm, add onions and peppers. Sauté until soft and slightly browned.
3. In a separate skillet, cook vegan chicken according to package directions.
4. While the veggies and chicken are cooking, prep your hoagie/sub rolls. Cut in half, spread butter, and toast lightly in the oven until golden on the edges.
5. Prep vegan cheese — melt it or warm depending on the brand.
6. Spread a thin layer of vegan mayo on each roll.
7. Scoop in cooked vegan chicken, top with sautéed onions and peppers, then pour over warm nacho cheese.
