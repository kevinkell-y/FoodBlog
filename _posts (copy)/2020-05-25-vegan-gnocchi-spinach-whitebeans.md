### 💡 Notes

This vegan skillet gnocchi is perfect for weeknights—one pan, under 30 minutes, and totally satisfying. Canned white beans and fresh spinach bring protein and greens to a cozy, flavorful dish. For extra richness, try finishing it with a drizzle of olive oil or a sprinkle of vegan parmesan. Use shelf-stable gnocchi to keep ingredients on hand anytime.
