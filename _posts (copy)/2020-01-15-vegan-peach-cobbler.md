## 🧾 Ingredients

- 3 cans of canned peaches (16 or 15.25 oz cans)
- 1/2 cup vegan butter, melted (I prefer Miyokos Vegan Butter for this, found at Trader Joes)
- 1 cup all purpose flour
- 1 cup cashew milk
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1.5 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Pour (or melt butter in) a 13 x 9 inch baking dish.
3. In a mixing bowl, use a whisk to mix together the flour, sugar, milk, baking powder, and salt.
4. Pour batter over the melted butter in the baking dish.  It is important that you do not stir- just pour batter over the butter.
5. Spread the peaches (and the liquid from the can) evenly around the baking dish. Again, do not stir- this is very important.
6. Sprinkle cinnamon on top. Bake in oven for about 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. This could be longer or shorter depending on your oven. 
7. Once golden brown, cool for about 10 minutes- and then enjoy!! Goes great with some dairy free vanilla ice cream!

### 💡 Notes

This easy peach cobbler is made with jarred peaches and best served warm with vegan vanilla ice cream. Great beginner-friendly dessert... just mix, pour, and bake!
