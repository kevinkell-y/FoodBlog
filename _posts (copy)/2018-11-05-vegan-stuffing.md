## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 12 oz box of stuffing mix (check ingredients to ensure vegan)
- 2 sticks of Vegan Butter (I use Earth Balance Butter Sticks)
- 1 cup of diced celery
- 1 cup of diced white onion
- 1 and 1/2 cups of Vegetable Broth

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. In a large saucepan on the stove, melt butter on medium high heat.
3. While butter melts, prepare a 9 x 13 inch casserole dish by spraying it with non-stick spray.
4. Once butter is melted, add in the celery and onions and saute until veggies are translucent.
5. Take off the heat, and mix in the stuffing mix. Gradually add/pour in the vegetable broth until all is moist.
6. Put mixture in your greased casserole dish, and cover with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove, take off foil, and put back in the oven to bake for another 10 minutes.
7. Enjoy!

### 💡 Notes

For the best texture, use day-old or slightly dried bread cubes so they soak up flavor without turning mushy. You can prep the vegetables and toast the bread ahead of time to streamline holiday cooking. Add vegan sausage or mushrooms for a heartier version.
