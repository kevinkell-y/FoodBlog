## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1/2 cup of cashews
- 3/4 cup of almond milk (can also use cashew milk or vegan milk of choice)
- 2 tbsp flour
- 2/3 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- Very generous dash of ground black pepper
- 2 cloves raw garlic + 1 tsp garlic powder
- 3/4 tsp italian seasoning herb blend
- 1 + 1/3 tbsp nutritional yeast flakes
- 1 + 1/3 tsp apple cider vinegar


## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. In a high power blender (I use a vitamix) add the first 6 ingredients (cashews through black pepper). Blend well until a completely creamy consistency without any graininess.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients into the blender (ingredients 7 through 10) and blend well until again you have a completely cream consistency.
3. Enjoy! That is it! The longer you let it sit the more the garlic flavor will pop!

### 💡 Notes

This is the best creamy vegan garlic sauce in the world. It tastes amazing with meatballs (see my [chicken meatball recipe](/vegan-chicken-meatballs)), over pasta, sauce for a sandwich....list goes on!

*Note that this sauce does not *heat* up well. I suggest letting it get to room temp and then use.

*You can easily double these ingredients to double the batch. I suggest doubling if making a large amount of pasta- this is an amazing sauce for a "fettucine alfredo" sauce!
