## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 16oz package of macaroni/elbow noodles  
- 1/2 cup of butter (1 vegan butter stick — I recommend Earth Balance) + 2 tbsp of vegan butter  
- 1/2 cup of flour  
- 2 blocks of cheddar Daiya vegan cheese — grated  
- 4 cups of plant-based milk (I recommend Not Milk brand or the creamiest you can find)  
- 1 package of vegan chicken (I recommend Daring grilled chicken) — cooked and diced  
- 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp buffalo sauce  
- 3 pieces of soft white bread  

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F, and spray a 13x9 or 14x9 casserole dish with nonstick cooking spray.  
2. Cook macaroni as instructed on package, using the minimum cook time or until al dente. Drain and set aside.  
3. While macaroni is cooking, melt 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) in a saucepan on low heat. Once melted, whisk in flour, and stir until smooth.  
4. Gradually stir in your plant milk. Continually slowly whisk until it comes to a boil. After 1 minute of boiling, stir in the cheese and 1/2 cup of buffalo sauce.  
5. Stir until the cheese is melted and everything is smooth.  
6. Add macaroni and chicken to the cheese sauce. Stir gently until mixed.  
7. Pour mixture into prepared casserole dish. Drizzle top with remaining buffalo sauce. Bake uncovered for 15–20 minutes or until bubbly. Let stand 5–10 minutes before eating.

### 💡 Notes

For extra crispiness, sprinkle with panko breadcrumbs and broil the top for 3–5 minutes. You can sub jackfruit or soy curls for the chicken if desired!
