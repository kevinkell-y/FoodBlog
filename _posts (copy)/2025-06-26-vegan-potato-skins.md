1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.  
2. Cut each potato in half. Use a sharp teaspoon to scoop out the center, leaving about 1/4 inch of potato around the skin.  
3. Toss skins with olive oil, then spread on a baking tray.  
4. Mix 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp sea salt, and 1/4 tsp pepper. Sprinkle evenly over potato skins.  
5. Bake cut-side down for ~30 minutes, flipping once halfway through until golden and crispy.  
6. While baking, make guacamole:  
   - In a bowl, mash avocados and mix with corn, black beans, chopped tomato, onion, garlic, lime juice, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 tbsp cilantro, and sea salt to taste.  
7. Once potatoes are cool, spoon guacamole into each skin. Serve immediately and enjoy!
