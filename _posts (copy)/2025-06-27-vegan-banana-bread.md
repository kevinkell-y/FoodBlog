### Ingredients

1. 1 stick vegan butter (e.g. Earth Balance), softened or at room temperature  
2. 1/2 cup of sugar*  
3. 2 flax eggs  
4. 3–4 bananas, finely crushed (4 for extra moisture!)  
5. 1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
6. 1 tsp baking soda  
7. 1/2 tsp salt  
8. 1/2 tsp vanilla extract  
9. Optional: 1 cup chopped walnuts

### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.  
2. Cream together the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl.  
3. Add flax eggs and mashed bananas, mix well.  
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.  
5. Add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture. Stir to combine.  
6. Add vanilla extract and walnuts (if using). Fold gently.  
7. Pour mixture into a greased loaf pan (or lined loaf pan).  
8. Bake for 30–35 minutes. Insert a toothpick — if it comes out clean, it’s ready!  
9. Cool completely before slicing. Tastes even better the next day.

> \*Sugar note: Most recipes call for 3/4–1 cup. I use 1/2 cup for light sweetness.

> \*As with most quick breads/cakes, it becomes extra moist and flavorful on day 2.
