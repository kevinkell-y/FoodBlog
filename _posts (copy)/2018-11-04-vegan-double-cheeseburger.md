## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 white onion, chopped
- Vegan Thousand Island dressing
- Vegan American-style cheese (e.g. Follow Your Heart)
- 2 Beyond Meat Burger patties
- 2 white hamburger buns (preferably with sesame seeds)
- Vegan mayo
- Vegan butter (optional, for toasting buns)

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Add olive oil to a skillet and sauté chopped onion until caramelized. (Optional: add a tiny bit of brown sugar.)
2. Heat a frying pan and cook 2 Beyond Meat burgers. Cook 3 minutes per side. In the final minute, place a slice of vegan cheese on each patty and let melt.
3. While patties cook, toast buns. Butter the inside lightly and toast open-face on a pan or grill until golden.
4. Spread vegan mayo on the bottom half of each bun.
5. Place one cooked burger patty on each bottom bun, add onions, then the second patty. Top with vegan Thousand Island and top bun. Serve hot!

### 💡 Notes

This is the ultimate plant-based copycat of the In-N-Out Double Double Animal Style burger.  
Use grilled onions, melty cheese, mayo, and special sauce for flavor perfection.  
Customize with pickles or lettuce if desired.  
Great for impressing meat-eaters or serving at cookouts!
