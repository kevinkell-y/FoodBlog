## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 cup unsweetened almond milk
- 4 tbsp of COLD vegan butter (I used Earth Balance Butter sticks)
- 1 tbsp fresh squeezed lemon juice
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 3/4 tsp sea salt

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.
2. In a cup, pour in the almond milk and lemon juice, and let sit to make your vegan buttermilk.
3. In a large mixing bowl, add all dry ingredients. I recommend using a whisk to make sure it is all combined well.
4. Add your cold butter into this bowl. Using your fingers, break apart the butter and mix together all the ingredients in the bowl. Stop when the butter pieces are very small and it looks like sand. 
5. Make a small "well" in the middle of the sand mixture, and pour in the vegan buttermilk mixture about 1/4 cup at a time. Use a wooden spoon to slowly combine as you add the buttermilk. Stop adding buttermilk when the mixture feels like a tacky, but moldable dough.
6. Lightly flour a surface and place the dough on top. Dust the top of dough with a little bit of flour, and gently turn the dough over on itself 5 or 6 times. You should hardly be kneading. If sticking, add more flour.
7. Form dough into a 1 inch disc, with as little handling as possible.
8. Next, form the biscuits by using either a 1 inch thick dough cutter, or something like a cocktail shaker to cut out your biscuits. I have neither, so I use a knife to cut an approximate size in the shape of a circle.
9. As you cut, place on a baking sheet in 2 rows. Make sure you have them touch on the baking sheet (this is very important).
10. Gently reform the dough and cut into more biscuits. Keep repeating this until you have about 7-8 biscuits.
11. Next brush some extra melted vegan butter on top of biscuits, and using 2 fingers press a small divot on top of each biscuit.
12. Bake biscuits for 10-15 minutes, OR, until fluffy and slightly golden brown. Serve, and enjoy!

### 💡 Notes

These vegan buttermilk biscuits are flaky, golden, and rich without any dairy. Perfect on their own, with vegan butter, or paired with a hearty soup or stew. The chilled vegan butter and gentle folding technique are key to achieving their layered texture.
