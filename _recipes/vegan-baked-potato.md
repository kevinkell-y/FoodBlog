## Ingredients

- 6-8 medium sized golden potatoes
- 1/4- 1/2 cup vegan butter
- 1 and 1/2 cups of Wayfare Jalepeno Cheddar Cheese or [vegan queso](/vegan-queso)
- Vegan Sour Cream. My favorite: Wayfare Sour Cream
- Salt (to taste)
- 4 Green Onions, sliced
- Olive Oil

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. Wash and dry potatoes, and poke holes with a forks all over. Rub with olive oil and any desired seasonings.
3. Place on a baking sheet lined with foil and bake for about 45 minutes or until cooked through all the way.
4. Slice potatoes in half, lengthwise.  Let cool a bit, and then scoop out the inside of the potato and place in a bowl. Leave a small layer of potato in the skins.
5. Melt about 1/4 cup of the butter, and brush the inside of the potato skins with it. In the bowl with the scooped out potato, add the rest of the butter, cheese &amp; salt. Mix well.
6. Scoop mixture into the potato skins, and bake for about 20-25 minutes in the oven. Remove from oven when starting to turn golden brown, and top with sour cream and sliced green onions. Enjoy!

### Notes

These twice-baked potatoes are ultra-creamy on the inside and perfectly crisp on the outside. Theyâ€™re ideal for make-ahead meal prep or holiday spreads and can be loaded up with your favorite toppings like chives, vegan bacon, or dairy-free sour cream.
