## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 pound of penne pasta
- 2 packages of Beyond Meat Burgers
- Red marinara sauce (about 1.5 jars or 1 jar + a can of crushed tomatoes)
- 1 white onion, diced
- 4–5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 container of Kite Hill ricotta cheese (or use homemade cashew ricotta)
- 1 bag of vegan shredded mozzarella cheese (e.g. Follow Your Heart or So Delicious)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- Italian seasoning

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Cook pasta according to instructions until just shy of al dente (it will finish cooking in the oven). Drain and let cool a bit.
2. Preheat oven to 325°F.
3. In a large skillet, heat olive oil and sauté diced onions and garlic until translucent. Add the Beyond Meat and crumble it into the skillet. Cook until browned and add Italian seasoning to taste.
4. Add your red sauce into the skillet with the meat and stir until well combined and hot. Set aside.
5. In a large bowl, mix all your cooked pasta with 2/3 of the red sauce mixture and 3/4 cup vegan ricotta.
6. In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of red sauce, then half of your pasta/ricotta mixture. Add another thin layer of sauce and a few spoonfuls of ricotta. Repeat with remaining pasta and sauce. Top with shredded mozzarella cheese.
7. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Then uncover, raise oven temp to 375°F and bake another 10 minutes to melt and brown the cheese a bit.
8. Let sit for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!
