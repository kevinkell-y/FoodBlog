## 🧾 Ingredients

- 3 cups of dried split peas
- 9.5 cups of water
- 1 large white or yellow onion, minced
- 4 celery stalks, chopped small
- 3 carrots, chopped small
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 2.5 tbsp of "Better Than Bouillon" No Chicken Base (or could use vegetable broth base version)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander (ground)
- 1.5 tsp kosher salt
- 1 tsp pepper
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp liquid smoke
- 1.5 tsp garlic powder
- 2 tbsp olive oil

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. In a large skillet, heat olive oil. Once heated, add onion in and saute until they become translucent and start to brown/carmelize. 
2. Add garlic, celery, and carrot into the skillet, and saute for about 5 minute or until the veg starts to become soft.
3. Rinse split peas, and add into a large crockpot. Add in ALL other ingredients, and stir well. Cook on high for 5-5.5 hours, or until the peas fall apart and creates a beautiful thick and creamy soup. 
4. Turn crockpot to warm, and cool off a bit before serving. Enjoy!

### 💡 Notes

This hearty split pea soup is perfect for batch cooking. It thickens as it cools, so if storing leftovers, add a splash of water or vegetable broth when reheating. For extra flavor, sauté the onions and garlic until golden before adding the rest of the ingredients.
