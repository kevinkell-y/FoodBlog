## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 pack of soft taco-size tortillas (about 12)
- 1 green bell pepper, chopped
- 1 white onion, chopped
- 1 pack vegan protein (e.g. vegan pollo asado or meat substitute of choice)
- 1 can black beans, rinsed
- 1 large jar salsa (use one with black & kidney beans for extra protein)
- 2 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed
- 2 tbsp chili powder
- 1–1.5 tsp cumin
- 1 can chopped green chilies
- 1/3 to 1/2 can red enchilada sauce
- 1 bag of vegan Mexican-style cheese shreds (So Delicious or Follow Your Heart)
- 1 tbsp olive oil

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. In a large skillet, heat olive oil. Add onion, bell pepper, and garlic. Sauté until softened.
3. Add your vegan meat alternative and cook according to package instructions.  
4. Once browned, stir in green chilies, black beans, corn, chili powder, cumin, and enchilada sauce. Stir to combine and simmer.
5. In a large 9x13" casserole dish, lightly oil or spray it. Spread 1/3–1/2 cup salsa on the bottom.
6. Begin layering: tortillas → meat mixture → cheese → salsa. Repeat. Finish with cheese on top.
7. Bake uncovered for 25–35 minutes or until bubbly and golden on edges.
