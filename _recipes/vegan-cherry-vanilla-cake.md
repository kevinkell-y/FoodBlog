## 🧾 Ingredients

- 2.5 cups + 2 tbsp all purpose flour
- 1.5 cups white sugar
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 1.5 tsp baking soda
- 1.5 cups almond milk
- 3 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp white vinegar
- 1 can cherry pie filling
- 1 container vegan vanilla frosting (i.e. Betty Crocker)


## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Spray your round cake pans with non stick spray.
3. In a large mixing bowl, use a sifter to sift the flour into the bowl, and then add the sugar, salt, and baking soda. Mix with a wire whisk.
4. Pour the plant based milk, vanilla extract, extra virgin olive oil, and vinegar into the mixing bowl. Use a wire whisk to combine. Do not over mix! Just mix until the large lumps are gone (small lumps are okay).
5. Pour the batter in the 2 cake rounds. Use a rubber spatula to the batter is even and reaches the edges of the pans.
6. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick can be inserted and comes out clean.
7. Cool cakes on a rack before frosting. When ready to frost, place the bottom cake round on a flat surface. Put a thin layer of frosting on the top of the bottom layer of the cake. Take your cherry pie filling, and spread a layer on top of the thin frosting layer. Place the 2nd cake round on top of the cherry pie layer.
8. Using a rubber spatula, frost the rest of the vanilla frosting on the sides and on top. ENJOY!

### 💡 Notes

*This vanilla cake works in a sheet pan (10x15 inch) or using 2 8 inch cake round pans. To do a layer a cake (like this recipe) , you will need 2 round cake pans.

*Overall, this is an extremely moist vanilla cake, perfect with any frosting!
