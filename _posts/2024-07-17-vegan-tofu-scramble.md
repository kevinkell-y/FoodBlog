## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 16oz package of extra firm tofu
- 1/2 tsp  salt (It is recommended that Kala Namak salt is the best for tofu egg scrambles)
- 1/2 tsp turmeric
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
- Olive Oil
- Any other veggie toppings you want to mix in


## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Heat a skillet on the stove with a healthy bit of oil (maybe 1 tbsp or more)
2. While skillet is heating up, put your tofu into a bowl and smash/break it up with a fork. No need to press beforehand.
3. Put tofu in your skillet, along with your salt, turmeric, and pepper. Saute for 5-6 minutes.
4. Add in any veggies you might want to add at the end until heated up, and enjoy!

### 💡 Notes

Kala Namak (Indian black salt) adds an extra eggy flavor that makes this scramble taste shockingly close to the real thing. For extra color and nutrients, toss in bell peppers, spinach, or mushrooms near the end of cooking. Serve with toast or wrapped in a warm tortilla for a satisfying breakfast.
