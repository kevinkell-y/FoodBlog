## 🧾 Ingredients

- 2 cups of broccoli florets, cooked to crisp tender
- 2 "cans" vegan cream of chicken soup: Double my recipe [here](/vegan-cream-of-chicken-soup)
- 2 cups of cooked white rice
- Pollo Asada! You can also use any other brand of vegan chicken- but Cena Vegan is my favorite!!
- 1 pack of french onion soup/dip mix
- 1 - 1.5 cups Vegan Cheddar Cheese shreds
- 1/4 cup Almond Milk

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 13x9 or 14x9 casserole dish with nonstick spray.
2. Cook Chicken according to package directions, and cook rice if you have not already. Cook broccoli until crisp tender.
3. In a large bowl, combine the rice, chicken, broccoli, cream of chicken soup, french onion soup mix, about 1/2 cup of shredded vegan cheese, and 1/4 cup of almond milk. Mix until combined well.
4. Pour mixture into your casserole dish. Top with remaining 1/2 cup of shredded vegan cheddar cheese. 
5. Cover dish with foil, and bake in the oven for 20 minutes, or until bubbly. Remove foil, and broil for the last 5 minutes to get the cheese nice and gooey.
6. Remove from oven, and let sit 5-10 minutes before enjoying!

### 💡 Notes

notes: >
  For an extra creamy texture, be sure to use a rich plant-based milk (like full-fat oat or soy) and don't skimp on the vegan cheese shreds. Let the casserole rest for 10–15 minutes before serving so it firms up slightly while staying creamy. If reheating, add a splash of plant milk or cover with foil to preserve moisture.
