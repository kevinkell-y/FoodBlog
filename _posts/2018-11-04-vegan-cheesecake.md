## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 Vegan Graham Cracker Pie Crust
- 2 1/2 cups raw cashews
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup + 1 tsp coconut oil (refined)
- 1/4 cup water
- 1/3 cup lemon juice (freshly squeezed is best)
- 1/4 tsp salt

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Prepare vegan graham cracker pie crust or set aside store-bought crust.
2. Soak cashews in water overnight in the fridge. When ready to make filling, dry or pat dry.
3. Combine all ingredients in a high-speed blender. Let run for 5–8 minutes depending on your blender and let run until the consistency is completely smooth. Every minute or so, stop blender and scrape sides down to make sure all “grits” are out.
4. Pour into your pie crust. Refrigerate for 1–2 hours or until firm/cheesecake-like consistency. Enjoy!
