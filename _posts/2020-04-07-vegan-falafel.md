## 🧾 Ingredients

- 2 cans of 15 oz chickpeas, drained
- 1 bunch of fresh parsley, chopped, stems removed
- 6-8 cloves of garlic, minced
- 2-3 tsp cumin (to your taste)
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1/2 cup all purpose flour
- 2 tsp salt (less if you want)
- Oil for frying (I use canola or vegetable, fill large skillet almost with 1/4 of an inch of oil)

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Food process or mince your garlic. In the food processor, add the chickpeas and pulse until chunky. Remove and put in a large bowl.
2. In food processor or blender mince the fresh parsley. Remove and put into the large bowl with the chickpea mixture. 
3. In the large bowl, add in your cumin, salt, flour and lemon juice. Mix well until combined with your hand
4. Shape falafels into patties...I usually make mine about 1/2 inch thick (you can shape to your liking).
5. Heat the oil over medium heat in a large skillet.
6. Place falafels in once oil is heated. They cook quickly, so flip after 2 minutes or so, or until they are golden brown. Cook on the other side, remove promptly and place on a plate with a paper towel.
7. Cool slightly, and enjoy!!
