## 🧾 Ingredients

- Tostada shells (1 per crunchwrap)  
- 1 container pico de gallo  
- 1 lb Beyond Meat ground or vegan protein of choice  
- 1 pack taco seasoning  
- 1 can refried beans  
- 1/2 cup sour cream (e.g. Wayfare or Follow Your Heart)  
- 1/4 cup nacho cheese (e.g. Wayfare)  
- 1/2 cup shredded lettuce  
- 1/4 cup chopped tomato  
- 1/2 cup vegan cheddar cheese shreds (So Delicious or Follow Your Heart)  
- 1 pack large burrito-sized tortillas  
- Nonstick cooking spray  

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Brown Beyond Meat (or other vegan protein) in a skillet with taco seasoning according to package.  
2. Warm refried beans and nacho cheese on stovetop.  
3. Lay out large tortilla. In the center, layer:  
   - Refried beans  
   - Vegan ground meat  
   - Tostada shell  
   - Nacho cheese  
   - Lettuce  
   - Tomato  
   - Sour cream  
   - Shredded cheddar  
4. Carefully fold the edges of the tortilla toward the center to seal everything inside (use another small tortilla or broken shell piece if needed to cover gap).  
5. Spray a pan with nonstick spray and place crunchwrap seam-side down. Grill for 2–3 minutes until golden, then flip.  
6. Serve hot with hot sauce, cilantro-lime dressing, or avocado!

### 💡 Notes

Inspired by Taco Bell’s iconic Crunchwrap Supreme — but totally veganized.  
Use gluten-free tortillas if needed.  
To save time, prep the fillings ahead for weekday wraps!
