## 🧾 Ingredients

- 8–10 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1/2 pound linguine or fettuccine (or pasta of your choice)  
- 1 pack of Beyond Meat Italian Sausage (or other vegan sausage)  
- 1 container Honest Stand Garlic Parm Dip (or your favorite vegan alfredo dip)  
- 1/2 stick of vegan butter  
- 1–2 tbsp olive oil  

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add pasta and cook according to package instructions.
2. While pasta cooks, heat a frying pan and cook the sausage. Crumble or chop it into bite-sized pieces and cook until crispy and browned.
3. In a separate skillet, add olive oil, butter, and minced garlic. Sauté until garlic is fragrant and butter is fully melted. Add more butter as needed for a rich sauce base.
4. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot. Pour in the garlic butter mixture and toss to coat.
5. Add the garlic parm dip and stir until everything is creamy and well mixed.
6. Add in the cooked vegan sausage and give it a final toss. Serve immediately and enjoy!
