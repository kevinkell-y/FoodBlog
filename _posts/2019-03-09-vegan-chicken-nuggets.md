## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 14 oz can of artichoke hearts- drained
- 1 14 oz can of garbanzo beans - drained
- 1/4 cup diced white onion
- 2-4 garlic cloves, minced (dependent on your taste)
- 1.5 cups of panko breadcrumbs
- 1.5 cups of cornmeal
- 2 tsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp liquid smoke (dependent on taste)
- 1 tsp poultry seasoning (optional)
- 1 tsp onion salt or seasoning
- 1 cup almond milk (or any plant based milk)
- 1/4 cup ground flaxseed meal
- 2 tbsp of flour
- 1 tsp paprika
- Salt and Pepper to taste
- Olive oil for frying

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. In a food processor, add in garlic and onion. Pulse until diced. Add in artichoke hearts, and pulse until chopped. Then add in:  garbanzo beans, 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup cornmeal, red wine vinegar, liquid smoke, poultry seasoning &amp; onion salt, salt and pepper to taste. Pulse in food processor until well combined and well blended.
2. Place mixture in a container with a lid, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Sometimes I will do this the day before but try not to wait longer than 24 hours.
3. In a separate bowl begin to make your batter. Whisk your milk, ground flaxseed, flour  until well combined and let sit for at least 5 minutes.
4. In a separate bowl or shallow dish,  begin to make your coating. Combine 1 cup cornmeal, 1 cup panko breadcrumbs, 1 tsp paprika, salt and pepper to taste.
5. When nugget mixture is done resting in the refrigerator, remove and shape into about 20 nuggets. This amount may vary based on your size preference.
6. In a large, flat skillet pour your olive oil in. This should be around 1/8 inch deep, or more depending on size of nuggets. Allow to heat over medium heat. While heating, finish preparing nuggets.
7. One at a time, place 1 nugget in the batter mixture covering both sides, remove and place into your dish/bowl where your coating mixture is. Flip to make sure all sides are covered.
8. Repeat the above until all nuggets are ready to be placed in the oil. When oil is hot, transfer as many nuggets that will fit in your skillet. Heat 1 side for about 4 minutes or until browned, and then flip and repeat. 
9. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels and let cool. Once all are cooked, enjoy with your favorite dipping sauce!
