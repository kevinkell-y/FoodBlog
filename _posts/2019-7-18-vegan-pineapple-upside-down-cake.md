## üßæ Ingredients

- 1/4 cup melted vegan butter
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 10-12 canned pineapple slices
- 1 jar of maraschino cherries
- 1 and 3/4 cup all purpose flour
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 3/4 cup almond milk
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 cup of pineapple juice reserved from can
- 1 tbsp white vinegar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup of extra virgin olive oil

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Spray a 9 inch cake pan with nonstick cooking spray.
3. Pour melted butter all over the bottom of the cake pan and make sure it is spread around evenly.
4. Sprinkle the brown sugar over the melted butter, again, making sure it is spread around evenly.
5. Spread a layer of pineapple slices along the cake pan dish- feel free to cut slices as needed to fill gaps. Also you can place along sides of pan.
6. Place maraschino cherries in the pineapple rings and anywhere there are gaps.
7. In a large mixing bowl, sift flour into the bowl, then add the white sugar, baking soda, and salt. Mix well. 
8. Add in almond milk, pineapple juice, vanilla extract, oil, and vinegar. Whisk by hand until combined.
9. Pour mixture into the cake pan on top of pineapple slices and smooth it with the back of a wooden spoon or spatula.
10. Put in oven for a total of 55 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the cake pan and cover with foil to prevent over browning and then return to the oven.
11. To see if cake is done, insert a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Let cool for at least 10 minutes.
12. When cooled, place a plate or cake platter on top of your cake pan. Hold firm and flip upside to set cake in the middle of the dish. Leave pan on for a few seconds, and then slowly remove. ENJOY!

### üí° Notes

This classic pineapple upside-down cake delivers a beautiful caramelized fruit topping and a tender, moist crumb. Let it cool completely before inverting for a clean release and picture-perfect presentation.
