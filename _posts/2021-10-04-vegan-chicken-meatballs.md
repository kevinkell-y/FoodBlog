## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 lb of ground vegan chicken. My FAVORITE is [Simple Truth Emerge Plant-Based Chick'n Grind](https://www.kroger.com/p/simple-truth-emerge-plant-based-chick-n-grind/0001111097027)
- 1/2 bunch of fresh parsley, chopped (I throw mine in food processor)
- 2.5 tsp dried basil
- 3/4 cup cashew milk or almond milk
- 1 vegan egg - I use a little Just Egg and pour it in.
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 3/4 cup- 1 cup panko breadcrumbs
- 1 pinch of nutmeg
- 1 heavy tsp of salt
- Olive oil to use for pan frying

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. In large bowl- add all ingredients! (except the olive oil). Mix well with your hands until it is a nice and combined meatball mixture.
2. Roll your chick'n meatballs, while preheating a skillet (I use cast iron) with about 1/4 inch of olive oil.
3. Once oil is heated, add your chick'n meatballs and keep turning to ensure all sides are browned. Once browned, remove and put on a paper towel lined plate.
4. ENJOY! I highly suggest pairing these with my [vegan garlic creamy sauce](/vegan-garlic-cream-sauce) and adding some pasta or yummy bread!

### 💡 Notes

These meatballs are crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and perfect with both red or white sauce in any pasta. For an extra kick, try adding crushed red pepper flakes to the mix.
