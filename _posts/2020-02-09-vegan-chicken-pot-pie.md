## 🧾 Ingredients

- ~2 cups of Pollo Asada.Beyond Meat Chicken would also work, or any vegan chicken substitute.
- 1 can of vegan cream of chicken soup (I added a few spoonfuls of vegan sour cream to thicken it up)
- 1/2 a 16oz package of frozen mixed vegetables (peas, green beans, carrots, corn), thawed
- 2 packages/tubes of refrigerated biscuit dough
- All purpose flour
- 1/2 cup of vegan shredded cheddar cheese

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. In 1 large bowl, mix in the vegan chicken, thawed vegetables, vegan cream of chicken soup.
3. Spray a muffin pan with non stick spray.
4. Sprinkle flour on a cutting board, and unroll the biscuit dough. Flatten biscuit dough slightly, and press into the muffin tin cups one by one, pressing against the sides and bottom of the cups.
5. Pour the chicken mixture into the muffin cups, about 1/3 cup at at time. Make sure filling is level at the top.
6. Optional: Sprinkle vegan cheddar cheese on top. Place muffin tins in the oven, and bake for about 15 minutes or until the biscuits are golden brown. Let cool slightly- and enjoy!

If you want less "dough/biscuit" slice dough rounds in half before pressing in muffin tins.
