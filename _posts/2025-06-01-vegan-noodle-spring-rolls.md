## 🧾 Ingredients

- 10oz package of pre-cooked soba noodles  
- 12 spring roll wrappers (approximately)  
- 2 tbs olive oil  
- 2 cups shredded green cabbage  
- 3/4 cup–1 cup shredded carrots  
- Teriyaki sauce (your favorite store-bought brand) or the seasoning packet that comes with your pre-cooked soba noodles  

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Heat olive oil in skillet. Add cabbage and carrots and cook for about 3–4 minutes or until they start to become slightly soft. Lower heat and add noodles until heated up.  
2. If using seasoning, follow instructions on packet. If using your own teriyaki sauce, add about 1/2 a cup in and mix well. Add more if desired. Toss well.  
3. Prepare spring roll wrappers by soaking them. A trick here is to put water in a pie dish, or a deep dish plate, and then lie the last wrapper in for about 15–17 seconds until it gets soft.  
4. Lay wrapper on a wet paper towel (this helps prevent it from sticking) on flat surface as you start to assemble.  
5. Add a large scoop of noodles/veggies on top and fold tightly, starting with the ends and then rolling tight. Enjoy!
