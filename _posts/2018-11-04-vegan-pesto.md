## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 bunch of basil leaves (about 2 cups, or whatever you have)
- 4–5 garlic cloves
- ~1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil (adjust to desired consistency)
- Optional: 1/4–1/2 cup frozen peas (adds protein + creaminess)
- 1/4 cup of pine nuts, cashew nuts, walnuts, or sunflower seeds
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast seasoning

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. In a food processor, put in basil leaves, garlic cloves, nutritional yeast, peas, and about 1/4 cup of olive oil to start.
2. Turn on processor and let it run until blended. Gradually add more oil until it becomes creamy.
3. Taste-test! Add more garlic, nuts, or oil until it reaches the flavor and texture you want.

### 💡 Notes

This pesto is great with pasta, as a sandwich spread, or a dip.  
Optional frozen peas boost protein and texture without altering flavor.  
You can use sunflower seeds or walnuts instead of pine nuts.  
Also great with basil + cilantro.  
Tastes even better the next day after the flavors marry.
