## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 store-bought pie crust*  
- 1/4 cup cornstarch  
- 1/4 cup sugar (I use Baker's Sugar)  
- 2 tbsp cocoa powder  
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt  
- 6 oz chopped vegan dark chocolate (70% cacao or higher for deep flavor)  
- 1 and 1/4 cups almond or cashew milk  
- 1 and 1/4 cups coconut milk (Thai Kitchen or similar, from the Asian food section)  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- 1 container So Delicious brand Coco Whip**  

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Prepare pie crust according to instructions.  
2. In a medium to large saucepan, whisk together cornstarch, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt.  
3. Gradually whisk in almond/cashew milk and coconut milk.  
4. Heat over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens and begins to boil. Let it boil 1 minute longer.  
5. Remove from heat and whisk in chocolate pieces and vanilla. Stir until completely melted and smooth.  
6. Pour mixture into prepared pie crust. Cover and chill in fridge for at least 4 hours (overnight is best).  
7. When ready to serve, top with Coco Whip or any other whipped vegan topping. Enjoy!

### 💡 Notes

*Store-bought crusts are easy (Marie Callender’s is a good vegan option), but homemade works too.  
**So Delicious brand Coco Whip is usually found in the freezer section near the Cool Whip.

This pie is intensely chocolatey and super satisfying. A must-make for chocolate lovers!
