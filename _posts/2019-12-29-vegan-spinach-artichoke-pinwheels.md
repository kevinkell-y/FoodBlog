## üßæ Ingredients

- 2 8oz tubes of vegan crescent rolls (most are, check ingredients)
- 1 can of 14oz artichoke hearts, chopped
- 1 cup of vegan cream cheese
- 2 cups of fresh spinach chopped (I food process)
- 1/3 cup vegan mayo
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp onion powder
- 1 cup shredded vegan mozzarella 
- 1/4 cup grated vegan parmesan cheese (I use violife or follow your heart brand)
- 1 egg replacer equivalent of 1 egg (I recommend Bob's Red Mill brand)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. In 1 large bowl, mix together the chopped artichoke hearts, chopped spinach, cream cheese, mayo, garlic powder, onion powder, mozz, parm. Add salt and pepper to taste.
3. On a large cutting board surface, roll the crescent roll dough out flat. Press the perforated edges together to seal together to form a rectangle (approximately 8 by 13 inches).
4. Spread the artichoke mixture on top of the dough until evenly distributed.
5. Starting on the short end, roll up slowly, pressing the edges together. Slice into 1 inch round pieces using a serrated knife.
6. In a pie plate (you might need 2) sprayed with nonstick cooking spray, place the pinwheel rolls cut side down next to each other, touching.
7. Make your egg with the egg replacer. Brush on top of the pinwheels with a pastry brush, and on any edges.
8. Bake in the oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the dough is golden brown. Serve warm, and enjoy!

### üí° Notes

These crispy, flaky vegan pinwheels are perfect for parties, potlucks, or game day spreads. 

*You can easily swap vegan cream cheese for vegan sour cream instead. Both taste great!
