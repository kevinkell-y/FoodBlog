## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (1 stick) of vegan butter- I prefer Earth Balance and at room temp.
- 2/3 cup white sugar (cookie) + 3 tbps white sugar (topping/rolling)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp apple cider vinegar
- 1.5 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp cream of tartar
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp almond milk
- 1.25 tsp cinnamon (dough) + 1 tsp (rolling/topping)

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 F.
2. In a stand mixer, add the stick of butter plus 2/3 cups of white sugar and cream them together (do not whip). 
3. Add in the vanilla extract and apple cider vinegar. Mix in (use mix setting).
4. Add in the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, 1 and 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and salt. Mix in by hand, not using the electric mixer. Mix until a crumbly dough is formed.
5. Add in almond milk and gently mix until it resembles a traditional cookie dough feel.
6. In a flat pie dish, mix in the remainder of your sugar and cinnamon. Prep a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
7. Roll your cookie dough into balls and then roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Place onto your parchment lined cookie sheet.  Sprinkle the cookie dough balls with whatever cinnamon sugar is left at the end.
8. Bake for about 10 minutes- and enjoy!

### 💡 Notes

These vegan snickerdoodles are perfectly soft, chewy, and coated in a delicious cinnamon-sugar crust. For an extra festive twist, try adding a dash of nutmeg or a splash of vanilla extract. Be sure not to overbake — they continue to firm up as they cool!
