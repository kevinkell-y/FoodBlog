## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 one-pound bag of elbow noodles
- 1 medium-sized butternut squash
- 1 to 1.5 cups of plant-based milk
- 1/4–1/2 cup vegan mozzarella cheese (e.g. Follow Your Heart shredded)
- 1.5 tbsp nutritional yeast
- 2 tbsp vegan butter
- Salt and pepper to taste

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut squash in half lengthwise and place on a baking sheet, cut side up. Roast for about 40 minutes or until soft and scoopable.
2. While squash roasts, cook pasta. When done, add vegan butter to keep pasta from sticking.
3. When squash is done, scoop out and blend with the rest of the ingredients (except pasta) until creamy and smooth. If it’s too thick, add more milk.
4. Add more nutritional yeast or cheese if desired. Add salt and pepper to taste.
5. Pour sauce over pasta and enjoy!

### 💡 Notes

A creamy, comforting vegan take on mac and cheese using roasted butternut squash as a base.  
Make it richer with more vegan cheese or keep it lighter with just the squash and milk.  
Perfect for fall meals, potlucks, or weeknight comfort dinners.
