## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 bagel of choice (everything bagels work great)
- Vegan breakfast sausage patties (e.g. Yves or Beyond)
- Vegan American cheese slices (e.g. Follow Your Heart)
- Vegan egg (e.g. Follow Your Heart Vegan Egg or Just Egg)
- Vegan butter of choice
- 1 tbsp olive oil

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Prep vegan eggs according to package directions.
2. Heat a nonstick skillet with olive oil. Add sausage patties and cook until browned on both sides (about 2–3 patties per bagel if small).
3. In a separate pan, cook the vegan egg flat and wide — aim for an even, foldable sheet you can cut in half and stack.
4. Cut cheese slices into squares and place one on each sausage patty. Let melt slightly.
5. Toast bagel with vegan butter (if desired).
6. Assemble: bottom bagel → egg → sausage + melted cheese → top bagel.
7. Serve hot and enjoy!
