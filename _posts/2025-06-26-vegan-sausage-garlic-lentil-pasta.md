### Directions

1. Cook lentil pasta according to package instructions.  
   *(Note: Lentil pasta may require a shorter cook time to avoid over-softening. Cook to your liking.)*  
2. Slice vegan sausage (or chop) and cook in a skillet with a bit of oil until crispy and brown. Chop into small pieces and set aside.  
3. In a pot, steam broccoli florets until tender and vibrant.  
4. **Make Garlic Butter Sauce:**  
   - Add garlic, butter, and olive oil to a large skillet.  
   - Sauté until garlic is just beginning to brown and butter is melted and infused.  
5. Add everything (sausage, broccoli, pasta) into the garlic butter skillet. Mix well and top with vegan parmesan. Serve and enjoy!
