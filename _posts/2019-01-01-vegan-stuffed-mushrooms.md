## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 box of white mushrooms
- [Beyond](https://beyondmeat.com) Sausage Hot Italian
- 1/2 cup Italian Bread Crumbs or Panko
- 1/2 - 3/4 cup of white onion, finely minced
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 1/4 cup of shredded vegan parmesan cheese (I like [Violife Foods Parmesan Block](https://violifefoods.com) 
- Olive Oil

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Start by preparing the mushrooms. Remove stem, and then scoop out the inside with a spoon to make a nice hole for the sausage stuffing.
3. Cook vegan sausage and onion in a frying pan on the stove on medium heat. Cook until sausage is browned. I recommend using a wooden spoon for this.
4. Once cooked, drain any grease. Add and mix in garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well. 
5. Add bread crumbs/panko, mix in, and then add the grated parmesan. Add a little bit of water and mix until it is pasty enough to place in hollowed out mushroom caps. *Make sure not to make too wet.
6. Place stuffing in each mushroom cap- putting in enough so it is slightly over the top of the mushroom, making sure it is tight and compact.
7. Pour a thin coat of olive oil in a baking dish. Put stuffed mushrooms in the baking dish, and sprinkle some vegan parmesan on top. 
8. Bake in the oven for 30-45 minutes (depending on size of mushrooms) or until the mushrooms are soft. ENJOY!
