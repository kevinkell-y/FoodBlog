## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 bag frozen french fries  
- 1 tomato, chopped  
- 1 package of plant-based ground (any vegan meat crumble)  
- 1/4 cup white onion, diced  
- 1.5 oz can tomato sauce  
- 2–3 tbsp chili powder  
- Vegan sour cream (e.g. Wayfare or Follow Your Heart)  
- Vegan cheddar cheese shreds (e.g. So Delicious or Follow Your Heart)  

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Prepare the vegan chili: In a skillet over medium heat, sauté your plant-based ground with a little olive oil. Once browned, stir in tomato sauce and chili powder. Add onion, garlic powder, or more seasoning to taste.
2. While chili cooks, bake the fries according to package directions.
3. Dice tomato and set aside.
4. Once fries are crispy, build your dish:  
   - Layer fries into a bowl or dish.  
   - Top with hot vegan chili.  
   - Add chopped tomatoes, cheddar-style shreds, and finish with a dollop of vegan sour cream.

### 💡 Notes

Try red onions, jalapeños, or avocado for garnish.  
For extra gooeyness, microwave the cheese on the fries for 30 seconds before serving.  
Inspired by the Del Taco version — but totally veganized and flavor-packed!
