### üí° Notes

The MOST AMAZING and flavorful enchiladas!! This has become my favorite vegan dish, and jackfruit is a perfect stand-in for shredded meat in these enchiladas. Use a good vegan cheese that melts well, and don‚Äôt skimp on the enchilada sauce‚Äîmake sure every layer is coated. These taste even better the next day!
