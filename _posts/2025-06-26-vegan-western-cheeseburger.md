## üßæ Ingredients

- 1 Beyond Meat Burger
- Frozen Vegan Onion Rings (I like Alexa Onion Rings)
- BBQ Sauce (your favorite kind)
- Lightly toasted hamburger bun(s)
- Vegan American Cheese Slices (I love Follow Your Heart American)
- Vegan Bacon (Herbivorous Butcher bacon or Upton‚Äôs Seitan Bacon)
- Vegan Ranch (Follow Your Heart Ranch or Daiya Brand)

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ Directions

1. Cook onion rings according to package instructions.
2. Cook burger according to instructions.
3. Lightly toast and butter your hamburger buns (I do this on the stove).
4. Cook burger patties on the stove. Once a side is done, flip and add the American cheese. Cook until cheese is melted.
5. While burgers cook, spread ranch on the bottom half of the burger buns, and a very light amount of BBQ sauce on the top bun.
6. Place cooked burgers on the ranch side of the bun, stack about 3 onion rings on top of the patty. Layer bacon on top of the onion rings, and drizzle more BBQ sauce on top. Place top bun on, and ENJOY!

### üí° Notes

This is my all-time favorite vegan burger. I loved the Carl‚Äôs Jr. Western Bacon Cheeseburger, and this is my veganized version. Let me tell you, no one will ever know this burger is vegan... it‚Äôs that good!
