## üßæ Ingredients

- 3 pounds of sweet potatoes, peeled and cut in 1 inch cubes
- Almost 1 cup of brown sugar
- 1/3 cup butter (I use 3/4 of 1 stick of Earth Balance Vegan Butter)
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp (heaping) vanilla extract
- 1/2 to 3/4  cup chopped pecans
- 2 cups of mini marshmallows (optional)

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
2. Place cubes of sweet potatoes in a large pot, and cover with cold water. Put on the stove and bring to a boil. Once water is boiling, lower heat to a simmer and cook until the potato pieces are very tender (about 15 minutes).
3. Put drained potatoes in a large mixing bowl, and mash with a potato masher. Add in butter, sugar, salt, vanilla extract and mix well to combine. If you think you need more of a certain flavor, don't be shy to add more!
4. Mix in about 1/4 cup of chopped pecans, and more if you prefer.
5. Spray casserole dish (13 x 9) with nonstick cooking spray and then spread the sweet potatoes in the dish evenly. Top with 1/4 cup pecans, and the marshmallows if you are adding them.
6. Bake for 25 minutes or until marshmallows are golden. Enjoy!

### üí° Notes

This dish is a holiday essential: creamy mashed sweet potatoes topped with a golden, crunchy pecan crumble. For a dessert-like twist, add a few mini vegan marshmallows during the final 10 minutes of baking.
