## 🧾 Ingredients

- 1 cup cashews (soaked—see instructions)
- 2 garlic cloves
- 4 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp hemp seeds
- 1 cucumber, peeled and diced
- 2 tbsp tahini
- 2/3 cup water (or less, just enough to blend smooth)
- 1 tbsp fresh chopped parsley
- 1 tbsp fresh or dried dill

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. Place cashews in a bowl and cover with hot water. Let them soak for at least 2 hours (or overnight) to soften.
2. Drain and rinse the cashews. In a high-speed blender, add cashews, garlic, lemon juice, hemp seeds, tahini, and water. Blend until creamy and smooth.
3. Transfer to a bowl and fold in diced cucumber, parsley, and dill.
4. Add salt and pepper to taste. Chill before serving.

### 💡 Notes

This vegan tzatziki is great as a dip, sandwich spread, or salad dressing.  
Make it the day before for best flavor infusion.  
To lighten it further, sub half the cashews with unsweetened vegan yogurt.  
Perfect with falafel, pita, or roasted veggies!
