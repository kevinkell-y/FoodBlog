## üßæ Ingredients

- 1 and 1/3 cups vegan chicken broth (I use [Imagine Foods Vegetarian No Chicken Broth](https://www.imaginefoods.com/product/vegetarian-no-chicken-broth) or you can buy vegan chicken bouillon cubes to make your own)
- 1 cup canned chopped green chiles, drained
- 1 cup chopped white onion
- 2 garlic cloves minced
- 1 cup vegan sour cream- your brand of choice
- 2 "cans" vegan cream of chicken soup
- 3/4 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground pepper
- 6-10 flour tortillas
- Cena Vegan Pollo Asada. You can also use any other brand of vegan chicken- but this one is my favorite!!
- 2 cups of shredded vegan cheddar cheese- I prefer Follow Your Heart, Violife, or So Delicious Brands


## üë©‚Äçüç≥ Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Combine the chicken broth, green chiles, onion, sour cream, salt, cumin, pepper, cream of chicken soup, and garlic in a large pot or saucepan on the stove. 
3. Whisk, and bring to a boil while stirring consistently. Once at a boil, remove from heat.
4. Coat a 13x9 inch casserole dish with cooking spray. Spread 1 cup of the "soup" mixture onto the bottom of the dish. Spread about 3 flour tortillas over this layer of soup. Top with about 1 cup of vegan chicken followed by about 1/2 cup of shredded vegan cheese.
5. Repeat layers starting with soup mixture. Keep repeating until last year, ending with the cheese. Pour extra soup mixture all over the cheese/top of casserole.
6. Bake in oven for 30 minutes or until bubbly. Let cool for 10-15 minutes, and enjoy!

### üí° Notes

This dish has a creamy, spicy kick thanks to the green chiles and vegan cheese. For extra richness, you can layer in a spoonful of vegan sour cream or top with crushed tortilla chips for a crunchy finish.
