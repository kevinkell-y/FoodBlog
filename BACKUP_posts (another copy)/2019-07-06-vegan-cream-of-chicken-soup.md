## 🧾 Ingredients

- 3 tbps vegan butter (your preference of brand)
- 1 tbsp all purpose flour
- 1/2 cup vegan chicken broth (I use [Imagine Foods Vegetarian No Chicken Broth](https://www.imaginefoods.com/product/vegetarian-no-chicken-broth) or you can buy vegan chicken bouillon cubes to make your own)
- 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
- Salt and pepper to taste

## 👩‍🍳 Directions

1. On the stove, melt your vegan butter and then add flour. Whisk to mix well until smooth.
2. Add and whisk in the rest of the ingredients: the broth and milk, with salt and pepper to taste.
3. Bring to a boil while whisking occasionally until it thickens.

### 💡 Notes

This vegan version of cream of chicken soup is rich, hearty, and ideal for cold weather or when you’re craving something nostalgic and warming. It also works great as a base for casseroles or savory pies.
